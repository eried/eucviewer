# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Notes for Claude (project context)

This repo is the **GitHub Pages deployment target** for the EUC Planet Trip Viewer.
The *working / development* repo is at `D:\GitHub\darknessbot-trip-viewer\` (FastAPI scaffold
remnants + `web/` assets). Historically that repo was deployed as a Python server; it has since
been converted to fully client-side, with the static assets living under `web/`.

When the user asks for changes here, they usually mean: edit the originals in
`darknessbot-trip-viewer/web/`, then mirror the files into this repo's root. Keep the two in
sync unless told otherwise.

## Architecture at a glance

- `app.js` boots Leaflet, loads cached tracks (IndexedDB → localStorage fallback), renders the
  trip tree. Paths are relative (`static/...`) so it works both at `/` and in a subfolder
  (`/<repo-name>/`) under GitHub Pages.
- `parser-worker.js` is a Web Worker (uses `importScripts` for JSZip). Parses `.dbb`/`.csv`
  off-thread and streams `progress` / `track` / `done` / `error` messages.
- `inspector.html` + `inspector.js` is a standalone page. It reads the `?i=<index>` query param,
  fetches tracks from IndexedDB (store `eucplanet-trip-viewer/currentSession` key `"tracks"`),
  falls back to `localStorage["dbb_tracks"]`, then drives a MapLibre terrain map + 5 canvas
  charts + SVG dashboard + playback loop.

## Storage keys (must match between app.js and inspector.js)

- IndexedDB database: `eucplanet-trip-viewer` (version 2)
  - object store `recentFiles` (keyPath `id`) — up to 5 recent uploads with full `tracks` array
  - object store `currentSession` (no keyPath; key `"tracks"`) — the most recently displayed
    `allTracks` array. **This is what the inspector reads.**
- localStorage `dbb_tracks` — same data, but silently dropped when it exceeds the browser quota
  for large multi-file datasets. IndexedDB is the reliable path.

## Why the inspector needs IndexedDB

For users with many trips, `JSON.stringify(allTracks)` exceeds the ~5 MB localStorage limit
and `setItem` throws. `app.js` catches silently. If the inspector only reads `localStorage`, it
shows **"Trip not found"**. Always read IndexedDB first in the inspector.

## Track schema (stable)

```
{
  name, date, dateStart, dateEnd,
  points:     [[lat, lon, speed, alt, volt, temp, battery, pwm, current, power, gpsSpeed], ...],
  timeseries: [[sec, speed, voltage, temp, battery, altitude, lat, lon, mileageKm,
                pwm, current, power, gpsSpeed, gForce, gForceX, gForceY], ...],  // downsampled to <= 500
  stats:      { points, rows, distanceKm, maxSpeed, avgSpeed, maxAlt, minAlt, maxVoltage, minVoltage, maxTemp }
}
```

Columns are **append-only** — legacy cached tracks lack the trailing fields, so
every reader guards for `undefined`. `gpsSpeed` (timeseries 12 / points 10) and
the three `gForce*` columns (timeseries 13-15) come from newer EUC Planet
exports; a value of `0` for `gForce` means "no IMU sample for that row".

Index `i` in `inspector.html?i=<i>` is the position in `allTracks` *after* sorting (newest
first, by `dateStart` / `date`). The inspector trusts this order — any change to sort logic in
`app.js` must be mirrored in how tracks are saved.

## Local development

It's all static — any HTTP server works. A `serve.cmd` is checked in for convenience:

```
serve.cmd                 # launches: python -m http.server 8000  → http://localhost:8000/
```

Worker + IndexedDB require `http(s)://`, not `file://`.

## CDN libraries (pinned versions)

- Leaflet 1.9.4 (main map)
- MapLibre GL 4.7.1 (inspector 3D map + terrain)
- JSZip 3.10.1 (loaded inside `parser-worker.js` via `importScripts`)
- AWS terrarium DEM tiles for elevation: `s3.amazonaws.com/elevation-tiles-prod/terrarium/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`

## Deploy

Just commit & push. GitHub Pages serves from `main` / root.
There is no build step. Bump the `?v=` query on linked JS/CSS in the HTML files when making
cache-visible changes. The footer version badge is driven by `document.lastModified`, so the
displayed date updates automatically on each deploy — no manual version bump needed for it.

## Things that tripped me before

- The inspector used to reference the FastAPI route `/trip?i=...`. In static mode it must be
  `inspector.html?i=...` (relative), and the button is in `app.js` → `buildTripItem()`.
- Web Worker `new Worker("static/js/parser-worker.js")` needs http(s), not `file://`.
- MapLibre terrain: DEM source uses `encoding: "terrarium"` and `maxzoom: 15`.

## Don't forget

- The dev repo also has `deploy_all.py` / DigitalOcean config — that path is now legacy
  (pre-GitHub-Pages). Don't deploy there unless asked.
- The user prefers local testing for non-trivial features before any deploy.
